## Statistical Inference Course Project Report, Part 1
Author: G. Purvinis

### Overview
This reports documents the final course project required by Coursera's "Statistical Inference" course. The project contains two parts. In Part 1, we are given an exponential distribution function as a population distribution, and asked to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that if we take n random samples from a population with mean mu and variance sigma^2, then the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, no matter what the population distribution is, provided n is sufficiently large (typically n>30). Furthermore, the sample variance will equal the population variance divided by n. 
### Part 1: Simulations Investigating the Exponential Distribution Function

#### Conclusion

### Part 2: Inferential Data Analyis Using "ToothGrowth" R Dataset package

#### The ToothGrowth dataset

#### Data Summary

#### Testing the data using Statistical Inference Techniques

#### Conclusion
